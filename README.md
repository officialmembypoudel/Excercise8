# C# Program

1. Create a struct called "Point2D" that represents a 2-dimensional point with x and
y coordinates as float values.
2. Create a method called "CalculateDistance" inside another class that takes two
"Point2D" objects as parameters and calculates the Euclidean distance between
them using the distance formula: sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2).
3. Create two instances of the "Point2D" struct and calculate the distance between
them using the "CalculateDistance" method. Print out the result.
